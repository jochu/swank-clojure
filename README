# Swank Clojure

Swank-clojure is an adapter that lets you use SLIME (the Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs) with Clojure.

Installation

1. Install clojure-mode.el. Either use ELPA[1] or get it manually
   install from source[2].
        
2. Invoke M-x clojure-install and follow the directions given. This
   will download and configure swank-clojure as well as other
   dependencies.

3. If you want to use SLIME with Common Lisp or another Lisp
   implementation, add your default lisp back in:

    ;; Example for sbcl to put in your .emacs:
    (add-to-list 'slime-lisp-implementations '(sbcl ("sbcl")))

4. Start slime!

    M-x slime

  Or if you have alternate implementations configured:

    M-- M-x slime clojure

  You can also start a Slime session for a given project:

    M-x swank-clojure-project

  This will prompt for a project dir and set up the classpath for that
  structure based on some existing Clojure conventions:

  * src/ and test/ - added to the classpath
  * lib/ - all .jars in here are added to the classpath
  * src/main/clojure, src/test/, target/classes, 
      target/dependency - added if pom.xml exists (maven-style)
